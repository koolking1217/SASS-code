// import is used to import or link another SASS file.
/*         SYNTAX for import is 
        @import " link/pathway to the file to be linked ";
 
        partials are created when the SASS files need not to be compiled.
        partial files will not be compiled to CSS.
        partial files/folders are created by inserting _ before the name of the file.

        for ex: look at the name of this file. There is no CSS file compiled for this SASS file. 

        for ex: SASS files of all pages of the webpages need not to be compiled/transpiled into CSS.
        
        they are linked with the main SASS file and are finally compiled/transpiled                      */
